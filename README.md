# Unit 1 Project: Fireball Island<br>
## a boardgame adaptation

Fireball Island was originally a board game from Milton Bradley released in 1986.  It quickly become a family favorite of ours and our set, which comes in a box two feet by two and a half feet, has been moved from house, to apartment, to house across multiple states. Even though Restoration Games rereleased the game, with multiple expansions (and you can buy it right now, highly recommended, go ahead, Google will find it for you!) my brother and I live on opposite sides of the country making it difficult to play. So it seemed it was time for a virtual Fireball Island. 

I began this project knowing that this first iteration would stay simple, just getting the beginning of the adventure together. 
The background is a picture of the original gameboard to bring some of the retro style and excitement to the flat screen.  There
will be even more exictement in future updates but right now you still get to play through the whole island, racing to be the first
one off the island with the treasure. Though Vul-Kar, keeper of the island's treasure, does not enter into the player's control yet
he is keeping an eye on everything and, most importantly, he will dispense fireballs whereever he sees fit!


## Playing the Game: game play is deceptively straight forward.  
- Player One rolls first, you roll by clicking on the "roll me" text.
- The game will take care of moving your piece to the right square. 
- Ordinary squares are transparent, card squares are green-ish.
  - The card drawn will be displayed next to the card stack, below the game board, and will be played automatically.
  - If the card is affecting another player that player will be choosen by Vul-Kar at random
  - If a fireball card is drawn it will be played totally at random. It may affect another player, or it may affect the player who drew it.
- Sneak past Vul-Kar with as much treasure as you can, the first player to escape the island is the winner!
- Even Vul-Kar gets the best of you you can restart the adventure at any time with the "Play Again" button.
- Light mode vs dark mode toggle button is at the bottom of the gameboard.
- To start the game, roll the dice!

# Future Game Features: there is always space to improve
- Players will be able to choose their own character images and input their name
- Players will keep an inventory of cards and choose when to play them adding to the depth of gameplay.
- Movement can be forward or backwards. If a player would rather move backwards to land on a card square that may be the best move!
- There can only truly be one Jewel of Vul-Kar. Once the first player captures it, other players can pass them to steal it for themselves
  but anyone arriving at the end without the jewel has no reason to leave the island. So moving backwards to snack the jewel may be necessary.
- The original Island had a system of caves that allow players to jump around the island more quickly, but with the potential of ending up in 
  the wrong spot. Our Island will soon have the same feature. 
- Obviously we want some John Williams, Jurassic Park-y, sounding music for arriving on Fireball Island!
